/nfs/hpc/share/soloww/OnlineNSDPO/online-ns-dpo/synthetic/utils/visualize.py:181: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
  fig = plt.figure(figsize=figsize)
